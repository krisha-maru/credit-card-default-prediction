Key Insights & Business Takeaways


🤖 Models Used

Logistic Regression

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost

LightGBM (Best performers for deployment)


🔍 Key Insights

Credit limit, age, and repayment history (PAY_0–PAY_6) highly influence default risk.

Customers with irregular repayments or high previous balances show higher probability of default.

Early prediction helps banks send reminders, adjust limits, and reduce financial losses.


🏦 Business Impact

Better credit-risk monitoring and early intervention.

Improved recovery and repayment rates.

Enhanced credit policy decisions & targeted marketing.


📈 Results

XGBoost & LightGBM achieved the best ROC-AUC and accuracy.

These models are suitable for real-world deployment due to fast training and strong performance.
